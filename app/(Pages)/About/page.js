            Our founder was unraveling‚Äîburnt out, heartbroken, and teetering on
            the edge of a breakdown. With nothing but silence and a half-stocked
            pantry, she grabbed the flour and started baking, just to feel
            something. The cookies came out lumpy, gooey, and wildly uneven‚Äîbut
            they were insanely good. Friends devoured them. And someone
            muttered,
            <span className="font-semibold text-amber-700">
              "Well‚Ä¶ chip happens."
            </span>
            <br /> That phrase stuck. So did the cookies. What began as a coping
            mechanism turned into a delicious rebellion against perfection. Chip
            Happens became a rally cry‚Äîfor flavor, flaws, and finding joy in the
            mess.

            don't chase perfection‚Äîwe chase flavor. Every batch is a little
            different, and that's exactly how we like it.
